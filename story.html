        <h1>Where The Wild Things Wed</h1>
         <p>We met at an art walk in Seattle, literally bumping into each other. We<br>
              started hiking together, a lot. We both love the PNW, the mountains,<br> the coast, everything. We’d be out on trails, just hanging out, talking<br>
              around a fire. It clicked. We were on the same wavelength. One time, we<br>
              were hiking and I complained about my boots and Jenny just stopped<br>
              and started tying my laces for me. That's when I knew. It wasn't some,<br> 
             grand gesture. It was just...us.</p>
             <p>
                 We’ve built a life together. It’s chill, it’s real. We love low-key<br>
                  adventures, but also appreciate good wine with friends. From those first<br>
                   hikes to figuring out life together under countless starry skies, we've<br>
                    always found our best moments in the wild.
